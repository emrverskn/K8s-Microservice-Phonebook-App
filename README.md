# Microservice Architecture for Phonebook Web Application (Python Flask) with MySQL using Kubernetes.

- Phonebook Microservice Web Application aims to create a web application with MySQL Database using Docker and Kubernetes. 
- In this application, we have a frontend service and a backend service to interact with database service.
- Each service will be managed by a Kubernetes deployment. The backend service will be a gateway for the application and it will serve the necessary web pages for create, delete and update operations while the frontend service will serve a search page in order to conduct read operations.
- To preserve the data in the database, persistent volume and persistent volume claim concepts should be adopted.
