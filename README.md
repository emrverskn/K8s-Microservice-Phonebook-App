# Project-206: Microservice Architecture for Phonebook Web Application (Python Flask) with MySQL using Kubernetes.

## Description

Phonebook Microservice Web Application aims to create a web application with MySQL Database using Docker and Kubernetes to give students the understanding of Microservice architecture. In this application, we have a frontend service and a backend service to interact with database service. Each service will be managed by a Kubernetes deployment. The backend service will be a gateway for the application and it will serve the necessary web pages for create, delete and update operations while the frontend service will serve a search page in order to conduct read operations. To preserve the data in the database, persistent volume and persistent volume claim concepts should be adopted.


- build Docker images.

- configure Kubernetes to run Python Flask app.

- improve network skills using `service` objects in Kubernetes

- configure AWS EC2 Instance and Security Groups.

- use git commands (push, pull, commit, add etc.) and Github as Version Control System.

- run the web application on AWS EC2 instance using the GitHub repo as codebase.

- build a Kubernetes infrastructure using Cloudformation.

## Steps to Solution
  
- Step 1: Download or clone project definition from `clarusway` repo on Github

- Step 2: Create your Kubernetes environment with cloudformation template

- Step 3: Prepare Dockerfiles for search and delete/update/create pages using Python Flask Apps, create images and push to your Docker Hub Repository.

- Step 4: Prepare search, delete/update/create and mysql parts.

- Step 5: Deploy your work on Kubernetes to showcase your application within your team.
